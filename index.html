            <p>The Mind Map example shows Ideas, Categories, and Things which are all Categorical Attributes. They
                represent one of many abstract or concrete objects. The Marks are Points which represent each of the
                Mind Map's Attributes and Lines which represent the links between the Attributes. The Points Channel
                is the Color, indicating which type of Attribute each point is. The Lines Channel is Positions which
                indicates which Points are connected.

                alt="Stacked Bar Chart">
            <p>The Stacked Bar Chart example shows bars split into Categorical Attributes [A, B, C, D] and Categorical
                Attributes within the bars. There are Ordered Attributes that vertically measure the bars and their
                sections. The Marks are the Lines for each section of the bars. The Lines Channels are Color to show
                each of the four sections of the bar as a different category and Length which indicates the quantitative
                measure on the chart's y axis.
